# Welcome to the ML Projects Repo
## Description
This is a repo where I play around with different Machine Learning Projects.
This is supposed to be a learning ressource for me and maybe it will even produce some useful tools.

## Overview
### titanic spaceship 
A modern Sci-Fi spin on the well known ML Beginner Project. This was the perfect first project to get to know the basics of ML.

### Store Sales Prediction
This is a project to get used to dealing with time series data. The dataset contains information about a number of stores in
differrent statistics of ecuadorian stores over time. The Goal is to predict the number of sales of a store in a given time to better plan logistics.

### football player evaluations 
The base of every ML Algorithm is a clean source of data. This is where Data Engineering comes into play. In this project, I wanted to 
create a database from different sources about football players and their market evaluation. Techniques htt i have used include webscraping, usage of external APIs and ETL. This might be a great base for a future Prediction Projects!
